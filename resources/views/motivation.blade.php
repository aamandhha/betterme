            <h2>Helpful tips for tracking habits effectively</h2>
            <div class="list">
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Start Small:</b> Begin by focusing on one or two key habits at a time. By starting small, you increase your chances of success and prevent overwhelm. As you build consistency, gradually introduce new habits into your tracking routine.</li>
                    <li><b>Set Clear Goals:</b> Define specific and measurable goals for each habit you track. Be clear about what you want to achieve and set realistic targets. For example, instead of saying "exercise more," specify a goal like "exercise for 30 minutes, three times a week."</li>
                    <li><b>Choose a Tracking Method:</b> Decide on a tracking method that works best for you. You can use a habit tracking app, a journal, a spreadsheet, or even a simple checklist. Find a system that is easy to use and suits your preferences.</li>
                    <li><b>Be Consistent:</b> Consistency is key when tracking habits. Make it a daily practice to record your progress. Set aside a dedicated time each day to review and update your habit tracker. Consistency helps you build momentum and stay accountable.</li>
                    <li><b>Track the Process and Progress:</b> Besides marking whether you completed a habit or not, consider tracking additional data related to your habits. For example, note the time of day, your energy levels, or any relevant observations. This information can provide valuable insights and help you optimize your habits.</li>
                    <li><b>Be Kind to Yourself:</b> Remember, building new habits takes time and effort. If you have an off day or miss a habit, don't be too hard on yourself. Instead, focus on getting back on track and staying committed. Treat yourself with kindness and patience throughout the process.</li>
